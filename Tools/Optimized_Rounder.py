    Calculates the quadratic weighted kappa
    axquadratic_weighted_kappa calculates the quadratic weighted kappa
    value, which is a measure of inter-rater agreement between two raters
    that provide discrete numeric ratings.  Potential values range from -1
    (representing complete disagreement) to 1 (representing complete
    agreement).  A kappa value of 0 is expected if all agreement is due to
    chance.

    each correspond to a list of integer ratings.  These lists must have the
    same length.
    The ratings should be integers, and it is assumed that they contain
    the complete range of possible ratings.
