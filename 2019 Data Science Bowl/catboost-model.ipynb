    "I had posted my very naive baseline at https://www.kaggle.com/mhviraf/a-baseline-for-dsb-2019. In that kernel I only used the mode label for each Assessment and I thought it should be very easy to beat. This kernel shows how you can beat that baseline by actually applying a model. In this kernel via `get_data()` function, I go over each `installation_id` and try to extract some features based on his/her behavior prior to the assessment. I will then train a `Catboost` classifier on it and make predictions on the test set. Note that the features I made in this kernel are so very basic and you can easily add many more to it. Good luck and happy kaggling. Don't forget to upvote if you found it useful ;)"
